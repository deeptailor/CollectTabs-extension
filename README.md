##Description

Collect-Tabs is a chrome extension used to store your most used tabs, and open them all at once at the click of one button.

##Our Story

This chrome extension was inspired when I realized I was wasting precious time reopening the same group of tabs every morning at work.

Collect-Tabs fixes that problem by allowing a user to "Collect" the tabs they want to open at a later time. When the user logs back in, all they have to do is click on the "Open" button and their collected tabs will be opened at once.
